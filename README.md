Ductu
=====

Final Project of the ProjectX Group. Makers Academy, May 2017 Cohort.

```

As a mentor,
So that I can organize learning tasks for a mentee,
I want to be able to create a To-Learn list.

As a user,
So that I have a personalized experience on the platform,
I want to have a personal account.

As a mentor,
So that I can personalize a To-Learn list,
I want to be able to assign the To-Learn list to a mentee.

As a mentee,
So that I can document my progress,
I want to be able to mark a learning task as complete.

```
