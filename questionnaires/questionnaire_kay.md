Questions:

- Is there one manual task that you want to get rid of when tracking the progress of students (Maincourse)  

    work out how students are doing
    good students approach
    bad students -> track them down
    automating checkup is a great way to get people to ignore


- What is your main channel of communicating with students  /  what is most effective

    heirarchy -> temporary
    trade-off is effort vs response rate
    the more you use each strategy, the less people pay attention


- As a coach, what are the most frequently sought-after forms of interaction   

    specific problems - want those to be taken away
    people want reassurance on progress
    assume that people who seek reassurance get through life by not believing that they are very good.
    perhaps try feedback at extremes only


- How do you encourage feedback?   

    broadly the same as heirarchy
    generally group feedback - preferred for future models


- What are the simplest ways to keep a student engaged?   

    tools to learn
    to use whatever anxiety to make them better software developers


- How often do you engage with students outside of group work and how does that happen?
