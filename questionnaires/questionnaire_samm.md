Questions:

- What are the manual tasks do you track progress of students (Precourse / Maincourse)  

      precourse:
      subtly different
      track specifically commits on repo
      coach modifiable
      pre-course coach
      slack engagement
      track how often you have to reach out
      using teachable - are there any extra tracking metrics avail? not sure
      pre-course engineer to automate
      loop of non-submit -> text -> submit
      treating pre-course like the course

      maincourse:
      off the back of automated - checking to see where people are
      pull environment
      tracking interactions
      transcript of interactions
      Reggio Emilio - write as much as you can about a meeting - look back and reflect - summarise.
      Looking at commits
      highlevel / zoning in on logic
      stored in hub
      coach meets with careers coach and business development

- What is your main channel of communicating with students  

      standups also for tracking - hard to capture value
      slack
      face-to-face is best
      one-to-ones -> people only learn during the 121 / disproportionate feedback / decrease self-led learning

- As a mentor, what are the key responsibilities?  

      high self-reliance
      high quality and self-expectation
      high confidence
      removing any need for the mentor

- What are best practices to keep a mentee engaged?  

      self-reliance is its own engagement strategy
      by making mentor redundant, we increase autonomy
      high challenge
      high-challenge - need others for support but can continue alone
      not so concerned about fun
      tools - 2 fundamental theories (scaffolding (jerome bruner) - spiraling on a topic, build find fault and refactor a model of the world // meta-cognitive strategies - the human learning brain is a pattern recognition machine, what points are learners moving into reliance-mode and get the learner to identify when that occurs and work around it)

- What is the favorite way of delivering content (to a mentee)?  

      A graph based model // anti-linear
      choose your own ending
      encouraging self-reliance    

- What is the most effective way to give feedback?  

      daily feedback for is ok - no incentive
      questions don't facilitate proper reflection
      lack of process has to be picked up by culture - how is our app going to manage feedback
      pick your battles - forms the culture of the cohort e.g. pick XP values early vs care and craft of the code

- When you are learning yourself, what is keeping you engaged?  

      all the time.

- When completing tasks, would it be motivational to have to complete them to progress?  

      see above on meta-cognitive strategies
      curricular sequencing - linear
      time-balanced sequencing

- Is a to-Learn list a useful tool?   

      prefers a suggestive model
      a graph based approach would make this a "I'll come back to this" list - bookmark manager
